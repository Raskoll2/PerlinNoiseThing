# Perlin Noise Generator

## About

The Perlin Noise Generator is a web interface built using Flask and vanilla JavaScript. It was created to help my sister pick a cool topological pattern for her crocheted blanket. She had 12 light squares and wanted to figure out how many medium and dark squares she needed to complete her design.

## Features

- **Adjustable Scale**: Fine-tune the pattern scale to get just the right look.
- **Custom Light Count**: Set the number of light squares (default is 12).
- **Medium/Dark Percentage**: Easily adjust the ratio of medium to dark squares.
- **Randomize Seed**: Generate a new pattern with a random seed.
- **Download Image**: Save your favorite patterns for later use.
